\section{Large-Scale Deployments}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\kostas{We probably do not need a traditional evaluation section but rather some numbers from King, Alibaba etc. taken from really large deployments with terabytes of managed state}

\paris{We can also benchmark and collect stats for the following pipeline impact factors: 1) state size (small and large state), 2) alignment (no snapshot - at least once - exactly once), 3) job graph length -> snapshot latency - worse recovery (rollback earlier). Ultimately, it is nice to show the costs of EtE, Snapshot  and Recovery Latency. 
We can probably include at least once cyclic graph as well.
