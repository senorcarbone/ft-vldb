\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\paris{To sum everything I already discussed with Gyula. We need to benchmark and collect stats for the following pipeline impact factors: 1) state size (small and large state), 2) alignment (no snapshot - at least once - exactly once), 3) job graph length -> snapshot latency - worse recovery (rollback earlier). Ultimately, we want to show the costs of EtE, Snapshot  and Recovery Latency. 
We should include at least once cyclic graph as well.
Optionally, we can benchmark output commit metrics as well using the simple rolling sink (and observe when files are tagged as 'committed' by all sinks).
