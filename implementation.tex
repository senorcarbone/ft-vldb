\section{Implementation and Usage}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{End-to-End Exactly Once Guarantees}

\subsection{The Embedded File System Backend}

\paris{Several new features are built on rocksdb (snapshots, compaction, incremental snapshots etc). We do not need to say many details, other than how everything integrates together I think. This is really up to discussion}

\subsection{Concurrent Snapshots}

\subsection{Queryable State}
\paris{This is just implementation-specific about how queryable state is implemented.}

\subsection{Asynchronous IO}

\subsection{High Availability \& Reconfiguration}
\paris{This is just an implementation specific problem. We should mention how we utilized zookeeper and offer some insights about what metadata we store since it is useful for many people actually.}
