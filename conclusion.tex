\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented Apache Flink's core mechanisms for managing persistent, large-scale pipelines with large application state in production. Flink is a flexible, reconfigurable distributed system which runs continuous, analytical, data-centric computation offering strong state consistency guarantees. A distinct snapshotting mechanism acquires a global view of the system periodically or upon demand which allows for coarse grained rollback recovery in a asynchronous, transparent and efficient manner. Snapshots allow for fundamentally practical reconfiguration usages, ranging from partial failure recovery to application versioning and debugging. Flink's ecosystem of modules and services built on its core offer different flavours of external state access and isolation while abstracting reliability concerns from the programmer. Finally, we discussed usages of Flink and the low execution overhead of Flink's snapshots in large-scale production deployments.

\para{Future Work:} Our main future focus on Apache Flink is to further improve its state management capabilities with incremental in-memory snapshots and automated system estimation of throughput and reconfiguration latency trade-offs for optimized incremental snapshots. Furthermore, we are planning to include the capability of auto-scaling pipelines according to runtime requirements without user circumvention. Finally, we want to support flexible state representations for iterative analysis through efficient bulk synchronous processing on streams.
