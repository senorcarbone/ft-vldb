\section{Consistent Pipeline State}

\subsection{State Types and Allocation}

\paris{Here we can describe state types and key regions briefly. There is nothing really too novel but it aids the understanding of how everything fits together.}

\subsection{The Pipelined Snapshotting Algorithm}

\paris{This is something that can also be pushed to the next section, not sure yet.}

\subsection{Cyclic Dataflow Logging}

\subsection{Rollback Reconfiguration}

\paris{This is probably the weekest part of state management. We restart the whole thing whenever we have to reconfigure and this is honestly a bit bad but hey it's simple. (also spark does this for every microbatch so maybe it is not that sad)}nai
