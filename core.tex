\section{The Core Mechanisms}
\label{sec:core}

\subsection{State Types and Allocation}

\paris{Here we can describe state types and key regions briefly. There is nothing really too novel but it aids the understanding of how everything fits together.}

\subsection{The Pipelined Snapshotting Algorithm}

\paris{This is something that can also be pushed to the next section, not sure yet.}

\subsection{Cyclic Dataflow Logging}

\subsection{Rollback Reconfiguration}

\subsection{Savepoints and State Recovery}

\paris{Savepoints and Checkpoints are now the same thing but we can probably highlight here how we can not only reconfigure parallelism but also push patches and use this for pipeline versioning}

\paris{Recovery is probably the weakest part of state management. We restart the whole thing whenever we have to reconfigure and this is honestly a bit bad but hey it's simple. (also spark does this for every microbatch so maybe it is not that sad)}
