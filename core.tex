\section{The Core Mechanism}

\paris{I am going to commit this whole chapter very soon. Still working on the presentation part to make it read well and be concise.}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\subsection{State Representations}

\paris{Here we can describe state types and key regions briefly. There is nothing really too novel but it aids the understanding of how everything fits together.}

\subsection{Concurrent Asynchronous Snapshots}

\paris{This is something that can also be pushed to the next section, not sure yet.}

\subsection{Cyclic Dataflow Logging}

\subsection{Reconfiguration and Rollback}

\paris{This is probably the weekest part of state management. We restart the whole thing whenever we have to reconfigure and this is honestly a bit bad but hey it's simple. (also spark does this for every microbatch so maybe it is not that sad)}
